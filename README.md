# Augmented Reality using OpenCV and Python:

Implementation of Augmented Reality (AR) using OpenCV and Python.

With the rise of ARKit and ARCore on mobile devices, I thought it be fun to create AR from scratch using OpenCV.


## TODOs:

- [ ] Jot down Computer Vision study notes
- [ ] Finish `README.md`
  - [ ] Setup


## Setup:

The main setup I used is an Anaconda3 environment, but the requirements aren't too many:

- Python=3.5
- OpenCV=3.1
- Numpy

OpenCV3 is installed via [`conda`](https://anaconda.org/menpo/opencv3):

```
$ conda install -c menpo opencv3  # if you're using Anaconda 2.7, then install 'opencv' and not 'opencv3'
```

## Disclaimer:

- This project is for my Computer Vision class and is not created to be a tutorial for building AR projects with OpenCV (for now).
